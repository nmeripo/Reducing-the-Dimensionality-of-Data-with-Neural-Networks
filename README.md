# Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for reducing the dimensionality of data using neural networks. Two main techniques are implemented: Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and autoencoders. These techniques are commonly used for feature learning and dimensionality reduction tasks in machine learning.

## Files

- **RBM.py**: Implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for dimensionality reduction.
- **auto_encoder.py**: Implementation of an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction.
- **train_test_MNIST.py**: Training and Testing script for validating the implemented neural network models on MNIST dataset.
- **utilsnn.py**: Utility functions for neural network operations, such as data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## Instructions

To use the provided scripts:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:
